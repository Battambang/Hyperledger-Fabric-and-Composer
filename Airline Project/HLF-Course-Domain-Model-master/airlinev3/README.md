ACME Airline V3

o Arrays

ACME airlines partner with multiple small regional airlines. These partners take up seats in ACME flights. There is a primary flight number assigned by ACME (AE101, AE102 ...). In the lecture you will learn how to declare arrays in a model to manage the flight aliases (e.g., BU345 is a Budget Air flight number = AE101)
